1. when doing siftDown, pay attention when checking for lete and right children
    for they might go out of arry bound.
    therefore, its better to check with heap.size();
    if(lson(cnt_root) < heap.size() && compare_less(heap[father(cnt_root)], heap(cnt_root))

2. when comparing value, remember they goes into the heap.

3. key functions are siftUp and siftDown.
